## Description

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/IFEANYIOK/SQL-Data-Cleaning-Covid-19-Layoffs-/blob/main/CLEAN%20LAYOFFS%20DATA%20OUTPUT.xls">Dataset</a>

**Skills Used:** Joins, CTE's, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** SQL Server Management Studio
  
## Results
In conclusion, the data reveals significant workforce reductions across industries(116 companies laid off 100% of workforce), with the consumer and retail sectors most impacted and the United States leading in layoffs. Large, post-IPO tech companies, particularly Amazon, Google, and Meta, executed major layoffs, with October 2022 to January 2023 showing peak impact. Given that 2023â€™s layoff numbers were already high by March(125,677), further cuts are likely. This analysis underscores the need for resilience strategies in vulnerable industries, especially for tech companies navigating post-IPO challenges, and suggests a potentially volatile employment landscape in the near term.

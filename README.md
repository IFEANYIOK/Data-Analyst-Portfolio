## Description
For this project we investigate the legally contested election results in Nigeria due to the questionable data integrity. Our purpose is to find out potential arears of irregularities through the available election data. This we will set out to achieve through highlighting outlier polling units whose results deviate significantly from their neighbouring units. This will serve as a pointer to possibility of rigging and undue influences.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/IFEANYIOK/SQL/blob/main/Anambra%20L%26L.xlsx">Uncleaned election Data</a>

**Skills Used:** **Preparation & cleaning of geocoded data, window Functions, Aggregate Functions, CTEs, Clustering, Outlier detection with standard deviation, Data Visualisation, report writing**

**Technology:** SQL Server Management Studio, Google API- Awesome table, Microsoft Excel

## Results
According to the findings we can safely say that LP had a landslide victory. Hence polling units where they were extremely outclassed could be contested. Nevertheless, the incidence of over-voting identified in an LP outlier polling unit in Ama-Okpogba, Anambra East, Anambra, calls to question the results from the LP outlier polling units.

## Results
In conclusion, the data reveals significant workforce reductions across industries(116 companies laid off 100% of workforce), with the consumer and retail sectors most impacted and the United States leading in layoffs. Large, post-IPO tech companies, particularly Amazon, Google, and Meta, executed major layoffs, with October 2022 to January 2023 showing peak impact. Given that 2023â€™s layoff numbers were already high by March(125,677), further cuts are likely. This analysis underscores the need for resilience strategies in vulnerable industries, especially for tech companies navigating post-IPO challenges, and suggests a potentially volatile employment landscape in the near term.

# SQL Data Cleaning, Exploration and Analysis Covid-19 Layoffs

## Project Objective
Examine the impact of Covid-19 on global job losses especially as it affected various industries, companies and countries between 2020 and 2023.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/IFEANYIOK/SQL-Data-Cleaning-Covid-19-Layoffs-/blob/main/CLEAN%20LAYOFFS%20DATA%20OUTPUT.xls">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
-Which companies went down due to 100% layoff of it's workforce?
-List of Top 3 companies that laid of the highest number of workers.
-Which indusry was most hit and least hit?
-Which Country experirnced the highest number of Layoffs?
-Which year saw the highest number of layoffs?
-In what phase of developement where the companies that laid off the most?
-At what period of times where the world most hit and least hit by the pandemic?
-List the top 5 companies in terms of layoff per year over the entire period under consideration.

## Process
Cleaning:
1) Stage my Raw data by creating a duplicate and name it Layoffs_staging.
2) Remove any duplicate data
3) Standardize data i.e check for errors and other things to make for a uniform data 
4) Check for NULLS and blank spaces
5) Remove any unnecessary columns or rows

Exploration & Analysis:
1) Determine the number of companies that had 100% layoffs ranked by Amount of funds raised'
2) Get the sum of layoffs per grouped by company in a descending order.
3) Get the sum of layoffs per grouped by industry in a descending order.
4) Get the sum of layoffs per grouped by country in a descending order.
5) Extract the year from date and find out the sum of layoffs grouped by year in a descending order
6) Get the sum of layoffs grouped by stage in a descending order.
7) Used Common table expression and window function(rolling totals) to determine trends of the pandemic impact over time
8) Used common table expression and window function(Dense_Rank) to detemine top 5 companies in termas of layoffs per year overt the period of time.

## Insights
- 116 companies laid off 100% of workforce, which means 116 companies most likely went down.
- Amazon, Google and Meta laid off the highest number of workers.
- Consumer and Retail industry was hit the most while Manufacturing took the lowest hit.
- United States was the country with the highest layoffs.
- For 2023 the layoff numbers will likely be high because this data was as at the 3rd month and its already 125,677.
- The large companies in the post-ipo phase laid off the most
- The world was most hit during between october 2022 and January 2023. The year 2021 was the least hit.
- A lot of the tech companies took some big hits.
  
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the data reveals significant workforce reductions across industries, with the consumer and retail sectors most impacted and the United States leading in layoffs. Large, post-IPO tech companies, particularly Amazon, Google, and Meta, executed major layoffs, with October 2022 to January 2023 showing peak impact. Given that 2023â€™s layoff numbers were already high by March, further cuts are likely. This analysis underscores the need for resilience strategies in vulnerable industries, especially for tech companies navigating post-IPO challenges, and suggests a potentially volatile employment landscape in the near term.
